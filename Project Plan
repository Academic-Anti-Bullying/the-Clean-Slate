The Clean Slate @ The eLife Innovation Sprint 2020
(https://sprint.elifesciences.org) 

Project Leads: Renuka Kudva (PhD, Scientist), Nafisa Jadavji (PhD, Neuroscientist), and Gabriela Gaona (Software Engineer). 

What is the project about?  
Workplace bullying and harassment strongly contribute to attrition and the mental health crisis in academia, and while some funding agencies have recently begun to acknowledge its existence and take action, there is so-far very little support provided for victims. 

Moreover, the stigma associated with reporting bullying among adults, the fear of retribution, and the influence that calling out bullying or harassment may have on one’s career, promotes a culture of silence. This is damaging, not only to those who continue to suffer under such a system, but also because bullying or harassing behaviours are perpetuated and normalised. 

We would like this to change, and this is what motivates us to build “The Clean Slate”! It’s time to start having open conversations (💬) about bullying in academia, and take the first step towards systemic change in the long term! 👐

Our Vision
“The Clean Slate” should be a safe space for individuals to anonymously (🔒) share their stories, seek support from their peers and have to access resources for support in their countries of residence. 
As the name “The Clean Slate” suggests, sharing stories and having conversations about workplace bullying and the feelings of isolation it invokes is the first step towards moving forward (🌱), getting support…. And wiping the slate clean. 
“The Clean Slate” is envisioned to be a mutual support-driven platform for early career researchers by early career researchers. 🤝🤝👩🏽‍🔬👩‍🔬🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏿‍🔬🏳️‍🌈🧑‍🔬👨🏽‍🔬🤝🤝
Our hope is that this project will ultimately allow funding agencies and heads of academic institutions and encourage them to implement a change in their policies. ⚖️

Why join us?
Why not join us?
Our project is built around the premise of inclusion, regardless of who you are, where you come from, what you look like, what your beliefs are and what you can contribute towards our goal. 
We believe that stories need to be told and listened to and that no contribution or idea is small or insignificant. We would like to get started on building a support portal from ground up and would appreciate help from anyone who shares our interest in working together as a community to provide support and strength to those that are struggling in silence. 
We will continuously strive to provide an open and supportive team effort where members feel valued, and if we stumble, let us know so that we can learn from each other, pick each other up, and move forward together.

The Slate
